# Assignment-No.8-PCA-with-Clustering

Perform Principal component analysis and perform clustering using first 
3 principal component scores (both heirarchial and k mean clustering(scree plot or elbow curve) and obtain 
optimum number of clusters and check whether we have obtained same number of clusters with the original data 
(class column we have ignored at the begining who shows it has 3 clusters)df

I did follow Steps-
1.Import Necessary Libraris like Pandas,Numpy,PCA,Matplotlib,Seaborn,etc.

2.Import Data

3.Data Understanding

4.Data Processing

5.Normalizing the Data 
  Correlation Analysis

6.Data Visualization
 6.1 Scatterplot
 6.2 Pairplot
7.PCA Implementation

8.Visulization of PCA

9.Checking with Other Clustering Techniques
 9.1Hierarchical Clustering
 9.2 K-Means Clustering

10.Value count of Each Clustering to analyze the report
